## Description

This Node.js app takes in user input choices to create a SVG file logo. The user selects color, shape, text (up to 3 letters), and is returned with a logo.

## Installation

To install the application, you would pull my files from this repo and install node.js. If node is not installed, visit the Node.js website to install. 

## Usage

Once you have node running, you will run the app ("npm start" on the terminal command line) and it prompt you with a series of questions to create your logo.

## Credits

I used the "Helpful SVG Resources" on the assignment page, w3.org, Stack Overflow, and w3schools.com
